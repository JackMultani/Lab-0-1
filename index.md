## About Me

Hello! I'm **Jack Multani** and I'm currently a **3rd year Computer Engineering student** at UCSD! In my freetime, I like to workout, play basketball, and go to the beach. In addition, I look forward to further exploring San Diego with my friends while participating in club activities or hackathons to gain more experience within CS.

I have experience in both front and back-end but I prefer to work in back-end as I like to manage and organize a software's data. Correspondingly, I enjoy working with **SQL** and am familar with the following SQL clauses: 
```
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN, INNER JOIN, ON, ...
```
Furthermore, from least to most favorite, I have experience in the following programming languages:
1. Python
2. C++
3. Java
4. C#

Over the past summer, I interned at the **San Diego Supercomputer Center**. The program's goal was to help developers
> practice developing applications in a real-world agile development model.
 
By working in a team of six other developers, I learned to effectivley colloborate with others to deliver a social media based mobile application that included all of our interests. Furthermore, I was able to get hands-on experience as a **full-stack developer**, learning and utilzing the following frameworks/libraries:
* React Native
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Redux
* MySQL

## Course Goals

In CSE 110, I look forward to gain further experience in creating an application by colloborating with my teammates. As the quarter continues, I hope to:
- [ ] learn HTML and CSS within applications.
- [ ] develop my skillset in team colloboration.
- [ ] maintain a healthy balance between programming and taking breaks.
